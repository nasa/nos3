  ccsds:     { apid: 0x06 }
  subsystem: ES
  title:     Executive Services Processor / Power-On Reset
  desc:      |
    <b>Description</b>
    This command restarts the cFE in one of two modes.  The Power-On Reset
    will cause the cFE to restart as though the power were first applied
    to the processor.  The Processor Reset will attempt to retain the contents
    of the volatile disk and the contents of the Critical Data Store.
    NOTE: If a requested Processor Reset should cause the
    Processor Reset Counter (<code>ES_PROCRESETCNT</code>)
    to exceed OR EQUAL the limit #CFE_ES_MAX_PROCESSOR_RESETS (which is reported in
    housekeeping telemetry as <code>ES_MAXPROCRESETS</code>),
    the command is <b>AUTOMATICALLY</b> upgraded to a Power-On Reset.

    <b>Command Verification</b>
    Successful execution of this command (as a Processor Reset)
    may be verified with the following telemetry:
    <li><code>ES_PROCRESETCNT</code> - processor reset counter will increment
    <li>New entries in the Exception Reset Log and System Log can be found<BR>
    NOTE: Verification of a Power-On Reset is shown through the loss of data nominally retained through a Processor Reset<BR>
    NOTE: Since the reset of the processor resets the command execution counter (<code>ES_CMDPC</code>), this counter <b>CANNOT</b> be used to verify command execution.

    <b>Error Conditions</b>
    This command may fail for the following reason(s):
    <li>The command packet length is incorrect
    <li>The #CFE_ES_RestartCmd_t.RestartType Restart Type was not a recognized value.

    Evidence of failure may be found in the following telemetry:
    <li><code>ES_CMDEC</code> - command error counter will increment
    <li>the #CFE_ES_BOOT_ERR_EID error event message will be generated

    <b>Criticality</b>
    This command is, by definition, dangerous.  Significant loss of
    data will occur.  All processes and the cFE itself will be stopped
    and restarted.  With the Power-On reset option, all data on the
    volatile disk and the contents of the Critical Data Store will be
    lost.

    Evidence of failure may be found in the following telemetry:
    <li><code>ES_CMDEC</code> - command error counter will increment
    <li>the #CFE_ES_LEN_ERR_EID error event message will be generated

    <b>Criticality</b>
    This command is not inherently dangerous.  However, it is
    possible for ground systems and on-board safing procedures
    to be designed such that they react to changes in the counter
    values that are reset by this command.

  title:     Resets the Processor Reset Counter to Zero
  desc:      |
    <b>Description</b>
    This command allows the user to reset the Processor Reset Counter to zero.
    The Processor Reset Counter counts the number of Processor Resets that
    have occurred so as to identify when a Processor Reset should automatically
    be upgraded to a full Power-On Reset.

    <b>Command Verification</b>
    Successful execution of this command may be verified with
    the following telemetry:
    <li><code>ES_CMDPC</code> - command execution counter will increment
    <li><code>ES_PROCRESETCNT</code> - Current number of processor resets will go to zero
    <li>The #CFE_ES_RESET_PR_COUNT_EID informational event message will be generated.

    <b>Error Conditions</b>
    This command may fail for the following reason(s):
    <li>The command packet length is incorrect

    Evidence of failure may be found in the following telemetry:
    <li><code>ES_CMDEC</code> - command error counter will increment
    <li>A command specific error event message is issued for all error cases

    <b>Criticality</b>
    This command is not critical.  The only impact would be that the system
    would have to have more processor resets before an automatic power-on reset
    occurred.

    <h1>Description</h1>
    This command allows the user to specify the number of Processor Resets that
    are allowed before the next Processor Reset is upgraded to a Power-On Reset.

    <b>Command Verification</b>
    Successful execution of this command may be verified with
    the following telemetry:
    <li><code>ES_CMDPC</code> - command execution counter will increment
    <li><code>ES_MAXPROCRESETS</code> - Current maximum number of processor resets before an automatic power-on reset will go to the command specified value.
    <li>The #CFE_ES_SET_MAX_PR_COUNT_EID informational event message will be generated.

    <b>Error Conditions</b>
    This command may fail for the following reason(s):
    <li>The command packet length is incorrect

    Evidence of failure may be found in the following telemetry:
    <li><code>ES_CMDEC</code> - command error counter will increment
    <li>A command specific error event message is issued for all error cases

    <b>Criticality</b>
    If the operator were to set the Maximum Processor Reset Count to too high a value,
    the processor would require an inordinate number of consecutive processor resets
    before an automatic power-on reset would occur.  This could potentially leave the
    spacecraft without any control for a significant amount of time if a processor reset
    fails to clear a problem.

  name:      CFS_ES_STOP_APP
  opcode:    0x05
  ccsds:     { apid: 0x06 }
  subsystem: ES
  title:     Stop and Unload Application
  desc:      |
    <b>Description</b>
    This command halts and removes the specified Application
    from the system. <b>NOTE:</b> This command should never be used
    on the Command Ingest application.  This would prevent further
    commands from entering the system.  If Command Ingest needs to
    be stopped and restarted, use #CFE_ES_RESTART_APP_CC or
    #CFE_ES_RELOAD_APP_CC.

    <b>Command Verification</b>
    Successful execution of this command may be verified with
    the following telemetry:
    <li><code>ES_CMDPC</code> - command execution counter will increment
    <li>The #CFE_ES_STOP_DBG_EID debug event message will be generated. NOTE: This event message only identifies that the stop has been started, not that is has completed.
    <li>Once the stop has successfully completed, the list of Applications and Tasks created in response to the <code>ES_WRITEAPPINFO2FILE</code>, <code>ES_WRITETASKINFO2FILE</code> should no longer contain the specified application.

    <b>Error Conditions</b>
    This command may fail for the following reason(s):
    <li>The command packet length is incorrect
    <li>The specified application name is not recognized as an active application
    <li>The specified application is one of the cFE's Core applications (ES, EVS, SB, TBL, TIME)

    Evidence of failure may be found in the following telemetry:
    <li><code>ES_CMDEC</code> - command error counter will increment
    <li>A command specific error event message is issued for all error cases
    <li>Additional information on the reason for command failure may be found in the System Log

    <b>Criticality</b>
    This command is not inherently dangerous, however the removal of certain
    applications (e.g. - Spacecraft Attitude and Control) may have a detrimental effect
    on the spacecraft.

  title:     Stop Performance Analyzer
  desc:      |
    <b>Description</b>
    This command stops the Performance Analyzer from collecting any more data.

    <b>Command Verification</b>
    Successful execution of this command may be verified with
    the following telemetry:
    <li><code>ES_CMDPC</code> - command execution counter will increment
    <li><code>ES_PERFSTATE</code> - Current performance analyzer state will change to IDLE.
    <li>The #CFE_ES_PERF_STOPCMD_EID debug event message will be generated.
    <li>The file specified in the command (or the default specified by the #CFE_ES_DEFAULT_PERF_DUMP_FILENAME configuration parameter) will be updated with the lastest information.

    <b>Error Conditions</b>
    This command may fail for the following reason(s):
    <li>The command packet length is incorrect
    <li>A previous Stop Performance Analyzer command is still in process
    <li>An error occurred while spawning the child task responsible for dumping the Performance Analyzer data to a file

    Evidence of failure may be found in the following telemetry:
    <li><code>ES_CMDEC</code> - command error counter will increment
    <li>A command specific error event message is issued for all error cases

    <b>Criticality</b>
    This command is not inherently dangerous.  An additional low priority child
    task will be spawned, however, to dump the performance analyzer data to a file.

    <li>The #CFE_ES_TLM_POOL_STATS_INFO_EID debug event message will be generated.
    <li>The #CFE_ES_PoolStatsTlm_t Memory Pool Statistics Telemetry Packet is produced

    <b>Error Conditions</b>
    This command may fail for the following reason(s):
    <li>The command packet length is incorrect
    <li>The specified handle is not associated with a known memory pool
    <li>The specified handle caused a processor exception because it improperly identified a segment of memory

    Evidence of failure may be found in the following telemetry:
    <li><code>ES_CMDEC</code> - command error counter will increment
    <li>A command specific error event message is issued for all error cases

    <b>Criticality</b>
    <B>An incorrect Memory Pool Handle value can cause a system crash.</B>
    Extreme care should be taken to ensure the memory handle value
    used in the command is correct.
